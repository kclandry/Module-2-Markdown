#### Module-2-Markdown README

This document will normally contain useful information, but for now it is just another document for the use of this example project.

The information not in this page will be found [in the other document in this directory](../master/Markdown%20Examples.md)

The information in this document will be below this horizontal rule.

I don't know much about code, so I will use the code I ripped from the example document, framed by the three tick marks and "javascript" to appear as code with syntax highlighting.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
This document will contain the table as well.

| Both        | The        | Clean     |
| :---------- |:----------:| ---------:|
| This column | this one   | this one  |
| is left     | is centered|  is right |

And|The|Less Pretty

This one|While this|And this
is right|is centered|is left

This document contained the H4 Header, the link to the other document, the horizontal rule, the code block with syntax highlighting, and the table.
