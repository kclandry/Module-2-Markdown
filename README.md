#### Module-2-Markdown README

This document will normally contain useful information, but for now it is just another document for the use of this example project.

This page will contain the information not contained [in the other document in this directory](../master/Markdown%20Examples.md)

The information still needed will be below this horizontal rule.

I don't know much about code, so I will use the code I ripped from the example document.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
This document will contain the table as well.

| Both        | The        | Clean     |
| :---------- |:----------:| ---------:|
| This column | this one   | this one  |
| is left     | is centered|  is right |

And|The|Less Pretty
---:|:---:|:---
This one|While this|And this
is right|is centered|is left

This document contained the H4 Header, the link to the other document, the horizontal rule the code block with syntax highlighting and the table.
